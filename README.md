# HelloFromNathan | CS246

From the assignment description:

"In this assignment, you will create a simple Java program and put it into GitHub. You will then ask one of your team members to make a change to your project. You will also make a change to another team member's project."

  1. Create a project in IntelliJ called HelloFrom<Name> (if you first name was Bob, then this would be HelloFromBob).

  2. Write code in your IntelliJ project to say "Hello, my name is <your name>". Run your program to make sure it works.

  3. Share your project into GitHub.

  4. Add all members of your team as collaborators for your project.
  
  5. At least one member of your team must make a modification in your project. You must make at least one modification in another team members project.
  
  6. Add a line of code in the program to display "Hello <your team members name>, my name is <your name>." Run the program to make sure it works.

  7. Commit and push your changes.
  
  8. After you have successfully updated someone else's project, take a screen shot of your repository in GitHub (instead of submitting code) and take the quiz.
